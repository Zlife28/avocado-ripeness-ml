Avocado Ripeness Prediction – ML Project

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether an avocado is ripe or not based on its features like firmness and weight. It’s my first machine learning project as a beginner, built with Python and scikit-learn.

Libraries Used:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

Steps Performed:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Feature Scaling and Encoding
3. Train-Test Splitting
4. Logistic Regression Model Training
5. Accuracy Evaluation

How to Run This Project:

1. Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/Zlife28/avocado-ripeness-ml.git
  cd avocado-ripeness-ml

2. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook avocado_ripeness_model.ipynb

Requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook installed
Packages listed in requirements.txt
