Avocado Ripeness Prediction – ML Project

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether an avocado is ripe or not based on its features like firmness and weight. It’s my first machine learning project as a beginner, built with Python and scikit-learn.

Libraries Used:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

Steps Performed:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Feature Scaling and Encoding
3. Train-Test Splitting
4. Logistic Regression Model Training
5. Accuracy Evaluation
